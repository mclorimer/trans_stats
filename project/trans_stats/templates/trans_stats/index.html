				<h1>I. Gender Identity and Expression</h1>
				<h2>a.) Identity</h2>
				<p>The word transgender is often used as an “umbrella term” intended to encompass the spectrum of identities and capture the diversity of people whose gender differs from the one they were thought to be at birth. However, language describing identity continues to evolve, and it is difficult to describe all of those identities using just one term. Acknowledging this wide range of identities, the survey asked respondents if they thought of themselves as “transgender.” Eighty-eight percent (88%) of respondents reported that they thought of themselves as transgender, while the remaining 12% used other terms to describe their gender and related experiences.</p>
			</div>
		<div class="row">
			<div class="col-sm-6">
				<p>Respondents were also asked how comfortable they were with the word “transgender” being used to describe them on a five-point scale from “very comfortable” to “very uncomfortable.” Eighty-six percent (86%) expressed that they were comfortable or neutral using this term, including 82% percent of non-binary respondents. Forty-three percent (43%) were “very comfortable,” and only 14% expressed discomfort with being described as transgender2 (Figure 4.1). </p>

				<h2>b.) Gender Identity Categories Used for Analysis</h2>
				<p>Respondents were also asked to choose only one
					term that best described their current gender identity
					out of six possible terms (woman, man, trans woman
					(MTF), trans man (FTM), non-binary/genderqueer,
					or crossdresser) to determine the gender identity
					categories used for primary analysis.
				</p>
				<p>
					Respondents were grouped into four gender identity categories
					based on their responses. These four categories
					are used throughout this report to discuss the
					experiences of those who completed the survey:
					transgender women, transgender men, non-binary
					people, and crossdressers.
					4 Those who said that
					woman or transgender woman best described their
					gender identity were included in the transgender
					women analytical category (33%), and those who said
					that man or transgender man best described their
					gender identity were included in the transgender
					men analytical category (29%). Overall, 62% of
					respondents were included in the transgender men
					and women categories. Three percent (3%) said that
					crossdresser best described their gender identity.
					More than one-third (35%) of respondents indicated
					that their gender identity was best described as nonbinary
					or genderqueer, a term often used to describe
					people whose gender is not exclusively male or
					female, including those who identify with a gender
					other than male or female, as more than one gender,
					or as no gender (Figure 4.2). Throughout the report,
					these respondents are referred to as “non-binary.”</p>

				<h3>c. Gender Assignment at Birth</h3>
				<p>Respondents were asked about the sex they
				were “assigned at birth, on [their] original birth
				certificate.” In this report, the term “respondents
				with male on their original birth certificate” is used to describe respondents who were thought to be
				male when they were born (such as transgender
				women), and “respondents with female on their
				original birth certificate” is used to describe
				respondents who were thought to be female
				when they were born (such as transgender men).
				More than half (57%) of respondents had female
				on their original birth certificate, and 43% had
				male on their original birth certificate. Of those
				who were non-binary, 80% had female on their
				original birth certificate, and 20% had male on
				their original birth certificate. </p>
