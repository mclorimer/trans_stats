				<p>With 27,715 respondents, the U.S. Transgender Survey (USTS) is the largest survey ever conducted
				of transgender people in the United States, providing a rich understanding of numerous aspects
				of their lives and experiences. In this chapter, an overview of respondents’ diverse gender
				identities and experiences with transitioning is presented. Additional characteristics of USTS respondents,
				such as race and ethnicity, age, educational attainment, and geographic location, are also presented. This
				information is discussed in the following sections:</p>

				<h2>I. Gender Identity and Expression</h2>
				<h3>a.) Identity</h3>
				<p>The word transgender is often used as an “umbrella term” intended to encompass the spectrum of identities and capture the diversity of people whose gender differs from the one they were thought to be at birth. However, language describing identity continues to evolve, and it is difficult to describe all of those identities using just one term. Acknowledging this wide range of identities, the survey asked respondents if they thought of themselves as “transgender.” Eighty-eight percent (88%) of respondents reported that they thought of themselves as transgender, while the remaining 12% used other terms to describe their gender and related experiences.</p>
				<p>Respondents were also asked how comfortable they were with the word “transgender” being used to describe them on a five-point scale from “very comfortable” to “very uncomfortable.” Eighty-six percent (86%) expressed that they were comfortable or neutral using this term, including 82% percent of non-binary respondents. Forty-three percent (43%) were “very comfortable,” and only 14% expressed discomfort with being described as transgender2 (Figure 4.1). </p>
				<h4>Figure 4.1</h4>

				<canvas id="figure4.1" width="200" height="150"></canvas>
				<script src="{% static 'trans_stats/js/figure41.js' %}""></script>
				<p>Respondents were also offered a list of identity terms from which they could check all terms that described their gender identity, and they were also given an opportunity write in a gender that was not listed (Table 4.1). In addition to the listed terms, respondents wrote in more than 500 unique gender terms with which they identified. </p>
				{% include "trans_stats/gender_identity_terms_table.html" %}
				<h4>b.) Gender Identity Categories Used for Analysis</h4>
				<p>Respondents were also asked to choose only one
					term that best described their current gender identity
					out of six possible terms (woman, man, trans woman
					(MTF), trans man (FTM), non-binary/genderqueer,
					or crossdresser) to determine the gender identity
					categories used for primary analysis.
				</p>
				<p>
					Respondents were grouped into four gender identity categories
					based on their responses. These four categories
					are used throughout this report to discuss the
					experiences of those who completed the survey:
					transgender women, transgender men, non-binary
					people, and crossdressers.
					4 Those who said that
					woman or transgender woman best described their
					gender identity were included in the transgender
					women analytical category (33%), and those who said
					that man or transgender man best described their
					gender identity were included in the transgender
					men analytical category (29%). Overall, 62% of
					respondents were included in the transgender men
					and women categories. Three percent (3%) said that
					crossdresser best described their gender identity.
					</p>
			</div>
			<div class="col-sm-6">
				<p>More than one-third (35%) of respondents indicated
					that their gender identity was best described as nonbinary
					or genderqueer, a term often used to describe
					people whose gender is not exclusively male or
					female, including those who identify with a gender
					other than male or female, as more than one gender,
					or as no gender (Figure 4.2). Throughout the report,
					these respondents are referred to as “non-binary.”</p>

				<script src="{% static 'trans_stats/js/figure42.js' %}""></script>
				


				<h4>c.) Gender Assignment at Birth</h4>
				<p>Respondents were asked about the sex they
				were “assigned at birth, on [their] original birth
				certificate.” In this report, the term “respondents
				with male on their original birth certificate” is used to describe respondents who were thought to be
				male when they were born (such as transgender
				women), and “respondents with female on their
				original birth certificate” is used to describe
				respondents who were thought to be female
				when they were born (such as transgender men).
				More than half (57%) of respondents had female
				on their original birth certificate, and 43% had
				male on their original birth certificate. Of those
				who were non-binary, 80% had female on their
				original birth certificate, and 20% had male on
				their original birth certificate. </p>




				<h4>d.) Development of Transgender Identity and Interactions with Other Transgender People</h4>
				<p>Respondents received questions related to
					the development of their transgender identity
					throughout their lives. A majority of respondents
					(60%) reported that they began to feel “different”
					from the sex on their original birth certificate at
					age 10 or younger, including 32% who began to
					feel different at age 5 or younger, and 28% who
					began to feel different between the ages of 6 and
					10. Six percent (6%) reported that they began to
					feel different at age 21 or older (Figure 4.3).

				<canvas id="figure4.3" width="200" height="150"></canvas>
				<script src="{% static 'trans_stats/js/figure43.js' %}""></script>
				<p>Respondents were also asked how old they
				were when they started to think of themselves as
				transgender, even if they did not know that word.
				One in ten (10%) reported that they began thinking
				of themselves as transgender at age 5 or younger.
				Sixteen percent (16%) began to think of themselves
				as transgender between the ages of 6 and 10, and
				28% between the ages of 11 and 15. Eight percent
				(8%) reported beginning to think of themselves as
				transgender at age 26 or older (Figure 4.4).</p>

				<h4>e.) Gender Identity and Current Age</h4>
				<p>The age profile of respondents7
				 differed widely by
				gender identity categories, with nearly half (47%) of
				transgender men and women being aged 25–44,
				compared to 35% of non-binary respondents, and
				29% of crossdressers. Non-binary respondents were
				more likely to be younger, with nearly two-thirds (61%)
				being aged 18–24, in contrast to transgender men
				(43%), transgender women (24%), and crossdressers
				(8%). One in five (20%) crossdressers were aged
				65 or older, compared to only 5% of transgender
				women, 1% of non-binary respondents, and less than
				1% of transgender men (Figure 4.6).</p>

				<h2>II. Experiences with Transitioning</h2>
				<p>Transitioning is a process by which a person begins
				to live in a gender that is different than the one on
				their original birth certificate. Not all transgender
				people have transitioned or intend to do so, but
				many do. Gender transition can involve many
				different aspects, including changing one’s clothing,
				appearance, name, and identity documents (such
				as driver’s licenses or passports) and asking people
				to use different pronouns (such as he, she, or they)
				than the ones associated with the gender on one’s
				original birth certificate. Transitioning may also
				include undergoing medical procedures, such as
				hormone therapy or surgeries, to change one’s
				physical characteristics. Some people make many
				of these changes while others do not, depending
				on their needs and resources. Additionally, some
				transgender people may desire and make some of
				these changes even if they do not intend to live full
				time in a gender that is different than the one on
				their original birth certificate. However, many people
				who want to take these steps are not able to do so
				because of financial constraints, safety concerns, fear
				of discrimination and rejection, and other barriers</p>



				<h3>a.) Full-Time Status and Transition</h3>
				<p>Nearly two-thirds (62%) of respondents were
				currently living full time in a gender that was different
				from the one on their original birth certificate.
				Throughout the report, the process of living full
				time in a gender that is different than that on one’s
				original birth certificate is described as “transitioning.”
				Twenty-two percent (22%) of respondents reported
				that they wanted to transition someday, 13% were
				unsure, and 3% did not want to transition (Figure
				4.7). Three-quarters (75%) of transgender men and
				women had transitioned, and 43% of non-binary
				respondents had transitioned (Figure 4.8).8</p>
				<h4>Figure 4.7 Transition status of respondents</h4>
				<canvas id="figure4.7" width="200" height="150"></canvas>
				<script src="{% static 'trans_stats/js/figure47.js' %}""></script>
				<canvas id="figure4.8" width="200" height="150"></canvas>
				<script src="{% static 'trans_stats/js/figure48.js' %}""></script>
				<p>Respondents were also asked what gender they
				were living in on a day-to-day basis. Thirty-five
				percent (35%) of respondents reported that they
				currently lived as a man on a daily basis, 30% lived
				as a woman, 21% lived as neither a man nor a
				woman, and 15% lived part time in one gender and
				part time in another.</p>



				<h3>b.) Age of Transition</h3>
				<p>Those who have transitioned reported the age at
				which they began transitioning, or living full-time
				in a gender other than that on their original birth
				certificate. Nearly half (43%) reported that they
				began transitioning between the ages of 18 and 24,
				and nearly one-quarter (24%) transitioned between
				ages 25 and 34. Fifteen percent (15%) transitioned
				under the age of 18, and 18% transitioned at age 35
				or older. Non-binary respondents and transgender
				men were more likely to have transitioned at a
				younger age, with 24% of non-binary respondents
				and 17% of transgender men transitioning under the
				age of 18, compared to 7% of transgender women
				(Figure 4.9).9</p>
				<canvas id="figure4.9" width="200" height="150"></canvas>
				<script src="{% static 'trans_stats/js/figure49.js' %}""></script>


				<h3>Number of Years Since Transitioning</h3>
				<p>The number of years since a respondent had
				transitioned was determined in order to provide
				valuable information and context for some of
				the respondents’ experiences.10 Nearly one-third
				(31%) of those who had transitioned had done
				so within one year of taking the survey, 38% had
				transitioned 2 to 5 years prior, 13% transitioned
				6 to 9 years prior, and 18% had transitioned 10 or
				more years prior (Figure 4.10). </p>
