          <p class="about-p">The 2015 U.S. Transgender Survey (USTS) is the follow up to the National Transgender Discrimination Survey, the largest survey ever devoted to the lives and experiences of trans people. The study was developed and conducted by the National LGBTQ Task Force and the National Center for Transgender Equality in 2008- 2009, and the results were released in the 2011 report: Injustice At Every Turn. As the single-most cited study about trans people—cited by media over 15,000 times—it has dramatically changed how the public and policymakers understand the challenges facing trans people.</p>
          <br>
          <h3>Purpose of the 2015 U.S. Transgender Survey</h3>
          <p class="about-p"><strong>Research: </strong>The National Transgender Discrimination Survey has been the community's go-to resource for helping the public understand trans people. It's shown us how many trans people have faced discrimination and harassment at school, work, in health care, in homeless shelters, in the criminal justice system, as well as many other areas of life. Going forward, the 2015 U.S. Transgender Survey (USTS) will give researchers, policymakers, and advocates the ability to see the experiences of trans people over time, how things are changing, and what can be done to improve the lives of trans people.</p>
          <p class="about-p">The USTS will cover a wide range of topics that reflects the lives and experiences of trans people and is designed to more fully examine specific issue areas that disparately impact trans people, such as unemployment and underemployment, housing, health care, HIV/AIDS, disabilities, immigration, sex work, and police interactions. Many of the questions included in the USTS have never been asked of trans people before. Like last time, the data set will be shared with advocates, organizations, and academics for years to come.</p>
          <br>
          <p class="about-p"><strong>Benchmark: </strong>The USTS will significantly improve measures in the survey to allow for comparing the lives of trans people to the U.S. population as a whole. This is crucial for demonstrating the disparities faced by trans people in the U.S. In addition, the USTS will be fielded every five years and will enable measuring of progress made over time.</p>
          <br>
          <p class="about-p"><strong>Education & Advocacy: </strong>The 2015 USTS will continue to be an important resource for use in education and advocacy. As with the last study, the USTS will contribute to public education about trans people and provide information for advocating for policy and social advances for trans people.</p>
